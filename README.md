## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS grid to create complex layouts. Also I learned how to attach an image to the background of an element.

### Continued development

I still want to continue creating more layouts with CSS grid because I feel i haven't yet gotten comfortable with it.
